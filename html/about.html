         <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>Human trafficking is a global phenomena. Over 40 million people are trafficked each year and trafficking is
        embedded within the global economy, as trafficked laborers create products that are shipped into our homes and
        trafficked sex workers work in cities around the world. The UN has taken up goals to prevent and monitor
        trafficking yet little is still understood about trafficking, as data collection, monitoring, and enforcement
        remain sporadic. This has not stopped countries from exploiting fears about trafficking, using the public’s
        lack of awareness of trafficking to make <a href="https://www.apnews.com/4f0e224371a74c00bcd6dd41dae5584f">
            false claims about trafficking</a> as a way to justify harsh border restrictions.
    <br><br>
    We used data from the International Organization of Migration, which contains information about people
    trafficked between 2002 and 2018 to create a website that engages the general audience and creates awareness about
    the topic of human trafficking, which is constantly an invisible type of migration. The visualizations are intended
    to be used as data exploration tools, both the varieties of ways trafficking operates--within and across countries,
    and involving both rich and poor countries--and to display how much data is still missing even from public
    data-collection tools. This will allow the general public, NGOs and other institutions to explore in detail the
        data and help them advocate for policies to prevent trafficking.</p>
        <h2>VISUALIZATIONS</h2>
    <p>
    The colors and fonts used intend to create a sober and dramatic aesthetic, to convey the seriousness of this
        topic, while at the same time artistic, to attract and engage a general audience that might not be
        familiar with human trafficking.<br><br>
        We wanted to engage the visitor from their first interaction with the website, which is why we start with a
        survey that the visitors can interact with, and show in real time what others believe to be the total number of
        people trafficked. By showing these results, we believe that the public will compare to others, but also learn
        how the general perception of the total number of people trafficked is actually lower than the real magnitude.
        <br><br>
        The two visualizations that we created are a dot map, to explore the demographics and characteristics of the
        people trafficked between 2002 and 2018, and a Sankey diagram, to explore the flows of people between countries.<br><br>

        In the dot map, every dot represents a person, from a total of XXXX. The data can be symbolized with different
        colors and ordered by different categories. This maintains the granularity of the data but allows to shows
        general patterns of the dataset. On the other hand, the Sankey Diagram shows the relationship between people
        trafficked and the location they have been trafficked from and to. This helps identify which countries are the
        ones where most people have been trafficked, the flow between countries, and where there is more internal
        (trafficked inside their own country) or external (trafficked to outside of their country) human trafficking.
    </p>
    <h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
    <p>
        As we sorted through and picked apart the dataset from the International Organization for Migration we realized
        that one of the biggest obstacles in the way of combating human trafficking is its lack of reliable and
        comprehensive data. The availability of data for each country depends heavily on the presence of IOM programming
        and their government’s response rating and policies against human trafficking. The paradox of this is that human
        trafficking data is most needed in places with the least amount of governmental supervision and international
        organization presence since that is most likely where it is the most invisible and the most prevalent. However,
        those places are also the countries with the least amount of available data in the database. As a result, places
        that appear to have low or high levels of trafficking in our visualization may just be those places that collect
        the least or most data on trafficking, or do the best job of detecting and monitoring trafficking.<br><br>
        Using the Global Slavery Index (hyperlink) as a reference for vulnerability to modern day slavery and governmental
        response rating, we find that of the top 25 most vulnerable countries, with scores ranging between 65.6 and 100),
        the IOM only has data on 3 and the aggregate data makes up only .84% of the entire database. Our main limitation
        in creating a useful visualization was the lack of comprehensive and representative data. The data we used to
        derive our information from validates the name of our project: Human Trafficking is a shadow - impossible to
        pinpoint and catch, and at many times invisible.

    <h2>ANTI-TRAFFICKING RESOURCES</h2>
    <p>If you suspect you’ve witnessed someone being trafficked, you should call the National Human Trafficking Hotline
        at 1-888-373-7888, text the hotline at 233733, or chat with the hotline on the hotlines
        <a href="https://humantraffickinghotline.org/">website</a>.

            Global Report on Trafficking in Persons</a> provides additional data on trafficking as well as region-level
            information on trafficking flows, and whose <a href="https://www.unodc.org/pdf/HT_indicators_E_LOWRES.pdf">
                human trafficking indicators</a> provide ways to recognize trafficking when you see it.</li>

            vulnerability and tracks government responsiveness to human trafficking.</li>

    <h2>TEAM</h2>
    <p>We are Cindy Si, Dani Chong, and Dan Powers, a team of three students at MIT who worked on this project for our
        Big Data Visualization and Society Class for our professor, <a href="https://dusp.mit.edu/faculty/sarah-williams">Sarah Williams</a>. Our assignment was to create a
        visualization to show information about a topic related to migration. We chose human trafficking because
        although it is a violation of human rights and is intertwined with the global economy, there is a lack of
        awareness about the topic and its real magnitude.
        <br><br>
        The inspiration for our visualizations came from <a href="https://kaz-ogiwara.github.io/works/viz4socialgood/?fbclid=IwAR1_0hXNFOxH6bT0AR18m41gZBpmkEalAuRdFhp1Gb-sGzcoJueMNBqmol0">Kazuki Ogiwara’s sankey diagram and map</a> displaying information
        on trafficking, and from the project <a href="https://conflicturbanismcolombia.com/index.html">Conflict Urbanism: Colombia</a> created by the Center for Spatial Research at
        Columbia University, and the Masters in Peace Building at the Universidad de Los Andes.
